## Introduction

Go (Golang) is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed by Google. It is known for its simplicity, performance, and built-in support for concurrency. This repository provides a structured approach to learning Go through hands-on examples and mini-projects.

## Why Learn Go?

- **Simplicity**: Go has a clean and minimal syntax, making it easy to learn.
- **Performance**: Go's performance is comparable to C/C++.
- **Concurrency**: Built-in support for goroutines and channels simplifies concurrent programming.
- **Ecosystem**: Extensive standard library and a growing community of developers.
- **Applications**: Commonly used for web servers, distributed systems, and command-line tools.
