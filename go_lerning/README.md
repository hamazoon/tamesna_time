# Go Learning  

This directory contains examples, exercises, and solutions aimed at understanding the Go programming language. Go (Golang) is known for its simplicity, efficiency, and strong support for concurrency. This directory will help you explore fundamental and advanced concepts of Go through practical implementations.  

## Directory Contents  

- `main.go`: A simple entry point showcasing basic Go concepts and integrating functions from other files.  
- `basics/variables.go`: Demonstrates variable declarations, constants, and shorthand syntax in Go.  
- `basics/functions.go`: Explores function declarations, multiple return values, and closures.  
- `basics/control_flow.go`: Covers control structures such as `if`, `switch`, and `for` loops.  
- `concurrency/goroutines.go`: Illustrates how to create and manage goroutines for concurrent execution.  
- `concurrency/channels.go`: Explains inter-goroutine communication using channels with examples.  
- `concurrency/sync.go`: Demonstrates synchronization techniques using the `sync` package, such as `sync.Mutex`.  
- `web/http_server.go`: Implements a basic HTTP server using Go's `net/http` package.  
- `web/router.go`: Provides an example of handling multiple routes and creating simple middleware.  
- `web/json_api.go`: Shows how to handle JSON requests and responses in a REST API.  
- `testing/math_test.go`: Contains unit tests for mathematical functions using Goâ€™s `testing` package.  
- `testing/api_test.go`: Provides tests for API endpoints, checking response status and content.  
- `testing/benchmark_test.go`: Includes benchmark tests to evaluate the performance of specific functions.  
- `utils/string_utils.go`: Contains helper functions for string manipulation, such as reversing and concatenating strings.  
- `utils/math_utils.go`: Includes utility functions for mathematical operations.  
- `config/config.go`: Demonstrates reading and managing configuration values using environment variables or a `.env` file.  
- `config/config.json`: A sample JSON file showcasing how to structure configuration settings for an application.  

## Purpose  

This directory focuses on exploring and applying key Go concepts, including:  
- Variables, functions, and control structures.  
- Concurrency with goroutines and channels.  
- Building and testing web servers and APIs.  
- Writing unit tests and benchmarks for Go programs.  
- Creating reusable utilities and managing configuration files.  

These exercises provide hands-on experience with Go and help you build practical skills for real-world projects.
